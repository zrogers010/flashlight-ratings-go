You are helping me build the #1 flashlight ratings and comparison platform.

This will be:
- A spec-driven flashlight database
- An algorithmic rating engine
- A comparison engine
- An SEO authority site
- Monetized via Amazon affiliate links
- Built as a data-first SaaS-style platform

Key features:
- Structured flashlight database (lumens, candela, runtime, battery type, IP rating, weight, etc.)
- Algorithmic scoring system (Tactical Score, EDC Score, Value Score, Overall Score)
- Smart Finder tool (user inputs preferences → ranked results)
- Sortable comparison tables
- Mobile-first UI
- Clean dark-mode design
- SEO-optimized pages
- Compliant Amazon affiliate integration (no white-label checkout)

Tech stack:
- Backend: Go + Postgres
- Frontend: Next.js
- SSR for SEO
- Structured schema markup
- Future: price updater workers + ranking recalculation jobs

We are starting from zero.

First task:
Design the database schema and scoring formula architecture.
